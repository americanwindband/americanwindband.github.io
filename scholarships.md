# Scholarships

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>We wish to thank you for your interest in our scholarship competition. The high school finalist will be awarded a $1,300.00 scholarship, and the two 8th grade finalists will each be awarded a $900.00 scholarship. The scholarship money will be paid to each student’s private teacher for future study on a band instrument or the band camp of the student’s choosing. Parents are required to be a part of the audience during the competition.</p>

        <p>We have a two-step audition process. Applicants will provide sound recordings of their solos for the first round of the competition. Judges will only consider the quality of the recorded performance but not the quality of the media used. Based upon those recordings, the scholarship committee will select contestants to compete in a live audition. Applications for our next auditions will be available in December.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to hearing from you!</p>
